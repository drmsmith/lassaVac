# lassaVac
This is the code associated with the upcoming preprint:
"Projecting health and economic impacts of Lassa vaccination campaigns in West Africa "
This code was developed by OxLiv Consortium members David R M Smith, Joanne Turner, Patrick Fahr, Paul Bessell, Emily Nixon, Koen Pouwels and Deirdre Hollingsworth.

This repository includes three main sections:
* A branching process model describing human-to-human LASV transmission throughout "districts" (ADM1 divisions) of West Africa, and accompanying code that prunes both spillover infections and human-acquired infections among vaccinated individuals
* A gravity model describing the geospatial spread of Lassa-X across districts, underlying an SEIR model describing within-district Lassa-X transmission and vaccination
* A health-economic model that post-processes epidemiological data (infection incidence over space and time) to estimate clinical and economic outcomes

# lassaVac.Rproj
*  An R project containing all necessary files and input data
*  housekeeping.R contains background functions and intputs called across multiple scripts

# LassaX/ Lassa-X transmission and vaccination
* (1) custom_EpiEstim.R
  *  Updates the estimate_R function from EpiEstim (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436519300350) to return daily estimates of Rt parameters (from Gamma distribution)
 
* (2) ebola_simulate_Rt.R
  *  Generates district-level Rt curves from case data from the 2013/16 West Africa Ebola outbreak (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2016.0308)
 
* (3) DiseaseX_gravity.R
  *  Generates trajectories of the geospatial spread of Lassa-X across districts, built upon a gravity model fit to Ebola 2013/16 case data (https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160294)
 
* (4) DiseaseX_initialConditions.R
  *  Creates initial conditions for numerical ODE integration, reflecting the geospatial spread of Lassa-X across districts and vaccination assumptions (rate of uptake and delay to first dose)

* (5) DiseaseX_ODEs.R
  *  Ordinary differential equations describing within-district Lassa-X transmission (deterministic SEIR model with vaccination)
 
* (6) DiseaseX_launchSimulations.R
  *   Script to run SEIR model in (5) based on Rt curves estimated using (1) and (2) and initial conditions generated by (3) and (4)
