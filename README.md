# CHIK-X

CHIK-X transmission model for 100 days mission evaluation of vaccine impact under different scenarios.

The code in this repository is based on Dr David Smith's code for Lassa-X transmission. David's code is associated with the following preprint:

> "Projecting health and economic impacts of Lassa vaccination campaigns in West Africa "
This code was developed by OxLiv Consortium members David R M Smith, Joanne Turner, Patrick Fahr, Paul Bessell, Emily Nixon, Koen Pouwels and Deirdre Hollingsworth.



# Running the model: repo structure

The following gives a high-level overview of the repo structure and components used/needed for the model to run.

```
./
│
│   1_CHIK-X_preprocessing_run.R                 // run pre-processing of raw data
│   2_CHIK-X_run.R                               // run the entire model
│   3_CHIK-X_diagnostics_postprocessing.R        // help visualising runs for diagnostics/post-processing
│   CHIK-X.Rproj                            // set working dir and run project
│   README.md

├───model                   // model components

│       CHIK-X_init_conditions.R        // (2) Calculate initial conditions for simulations (ODE relic)
│       CHIK-X_sim.R                    // (3) Run simulation
│       utils.R                         // sourced by CHIK-X_sim.R
│       misc.R                          // help with debugging / benchmarking etc, not used by model
│       _spread_diagnostics.R           // help with debugging the spread model for fine-tuning
├───res                     // results saved here
└───preprocessing           // see below, files for raw data processing for model inputs
```


Below are more details on the data files which are required by the model to run the simulations. These are generated by the scripts in the pre-processing directory (see `./preprocessing/README.md` for more details). Running `./1_CHIK-X_preprocessing_run.R` should generate these or similar files
