# lassaVac
This is the code associated with the upcoming preprint:
"Projecting health and economic impacts of Lassa vaccination campaigns in West Africa "
This code was developed by OxLiv Consortium members David R M Smith, Joanne Turner, Patrick Fahr, Paul Bessell, Emily Nixon, Koen Pouwels and Deirdre Hollingsworth.

This project includes:
* A branching process model describing human-to-human LASV transmission, and accompanying code that prunes both spillover infections and human-acquired infections among vaccinated individuals
* A gravity model describing the geospatial spread of Lassa-X throughout "districts" (ADM1 divisions) of West Africa, underlying an SEIR model describing within-district Lassa-X transmission and vaccination

# lassaVac.Rproj
*  An R project containing all necessary files and input data
*  housekeeping.R contains background functions and intputs called across multiple scripts

*  
# LASV transmission and vaccination

# Lassa-X transmission and vaccination
* (1) ODEs.R:
* 
  *  File containing ODEs
